<h1>
<center>Solving proportions - "Rita's Pancakes"</center>
</h1>
<h2>
    EDIT: I'm pretty sure this is wrong! (It just happens to work w/ this prob)
    
Chef Rita is cooking for a Sunday brunch.
She knows that 22 pancakes can feed 8 people.
She is wondering how many people (p) she can feed with 55 pancakes.
She assumes each person eats the same quantity of pancakes.
<br><br>
How many people can Rita feed with 55 pancakes?
<br><br>
We're dealing with a proportional relationship, so each ratio of pancakes to people must be equivalent:
<br>
$$\dfrac{55\text{ pancakes}}{p \text{ people}} = \dfrac{22\text{ pancakes}}{8\text{ people}}$$
<br>
Live Clojure function:
<pre><code class="language-klipse">
(defn pancakes [num-cakes will-feed num-people]
  (filter #(= (/ num-cakes %)
            (/ will-feed num-people))
        (range 100)))

(pancakes 55 22 8)
</code></pre>
Solve by cross-multiplication:
<br>
$$\dfrac{55}{p } = \dfrac{22}{8}  \\\\$$
Multiply both sides by 8:
$$8\cdot\dfrac{55}{p } = \dfrac{22}{8} \cdot {8}$$
$$8\cdot \dfrac{55}{p} = 22$$
Multiply both sides by p:
$$p \cdot 8\cdot \dfrac{55}{p} = 22 \cdot p$$
$$8 \cdot 55 = 22 \cdot p$$
$$440 = 22p$$
Divide both sides by 22:
$$p = \dfrac{440}{22}$$
$$p=20$$
Rita can serve 20 people with 55 pancakes.
