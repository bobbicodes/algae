After learning how to fly, Wendy reduced her daily commute time by $75\%$. Previously, her commute took $m$ minutes.
<br><br>
How can we represent Wendy's commute time after she learned how to fly?
</h2>
Before learning how to fly, Wendy spent ${m}$ minutes on her commute daily. After learning how to fly, she spends $75\%$ less time commuting.
<br><br>
So Wendy spends ${75\%\cdot m}$ fewer minutes commuting daily than she used to.
<br><br>
That means Wendy spends ${m}-{75\% \cdot m}$ minutes commuting.
<br><br>
Because $75\%$ means $75$ per hundred, we can write it in equivalent forms:
$$\begin{aligned} 75\%&=\dfrac{75}{100}\\\\ &=\dfrac{3}{4}\\\\ &=0.75 \end{aligned}$$
Equivalent ways of writing Wendy's commute time after she learned how to fly:
$$\begin{aligned} m-{75\%} \cdot m&=m-{0.75}m\\\\ &=m(1-{0.75})\\\\ &=m(0.25)\\\\ &=0.25m \\\\ &=\dfrac{1}{4}m \end{aligned}$$
<h2>
The expressions $0.25m$ and $\dfrac{1}{4}m$ each could represent Wendy's commute time, in minutes, after she learned how to fly.
<br><br>
A caterpillar eats 1400% of its birth mass in one day. The caterpillar's birth mass is $m$ grams.
<br><br>
The expressions $14m$ and $\dfrac{1400}{100}m$ each could represent the amount of food, in grams, the caterpillar eats in one day.
<br><br>
Crispy Clover, a popular vegetarian restaurant, introduced a new menu that has 20% more dishes than the previous menu. The previous menu had $D$ dishes.
<br><br>
The expressions $D+\dfrac{1}{5}D$ and $1.2D$ each could represent the number of dishes on the new menu.
<br><br>
After Batman brought the Joker to justice, the crime rate in Arkham City decreased by 12%. Previously, the crime rate was $c$ incidents per 1000 people.
<br><br>
The expressions $0.88c$ and $\dfrac{22}{25}c$ each could represent the crime rate in Arkham City after Batman brought the Joker to justice.
<br><br>
A new soup recipe contains 33% less sodium per serving than the old soup recipe. The old soup recipe contained $x$ milligrams of sodium per serving.
<br><br>
The expressions $0.67x$ and $\left(1-\dfrac{33}{100}\right)x$ each could represent the amount of sodium per serving, in milligrams, in the new soup recipe.
<br><br>
While on vacation, Enzo sleeps 115% as long as he does while school is in session. He sleeps an average of $S$ hours per day while he is on vacation.
<br><br>
The expressions $\dfrac{S}{1.15}$ and $\dfrac{100}{115}S$ each could represent the number of hours Enzo sleeps on average while school is in session.
<br><br>
After reading 80% of her e-mails in her inbox, Danette still has $M$ unread e-mails.
<br><br>
Danette started with 100% of her e-mails. After reading 80% of her e-mails, she has ${M}$ unread e-mails remaining.
<br><br>
So, ${M}$ represents $100\%-80\%={20\%}$ of the total number of e-mails.
<br><br>
That means the total number of e-mails is $\dfrac{{M}}{{20\%}}\cdot100\%$.
<br><br>
Because 20% means 20 per hundred, we can write it in equivalent forms.
$$\begin{aligned} 20\%&=\dfrac{20}{100}\\\\ &=\dfrac{1}{5}\\\\ &=0.2 \end{aligned}$$
Let's find equivalent ways of writing the total number of e-mails.
$$\begin{aligned} \dfrac{M}{{20\%}}\cdot 100\% &= \dfrac{M}{{0.2}}\cdot1 \\\\ &=\dfrac{M}{{1-0.8}} \\\\ &=\dfrac{M}{{\left(\dfrac{1}{5}\right)}} \\\\ &={5}M \end{aligned}$$

Eiko is wearing a magic ring that increases the power of her healing spell by 30%. Without the ring, her healing spell restores H health points.
<br><br>
The healing spell restores $30\%\cdot H$ more health points with the ring than without it.
<br><br>
That means the healing spell restores $30\%\cdot H+{H}$ health points with the ring.
<br><br>
Because 30% means 30 per hundred, we can write it in equivalent forms.
$$\begin{aligned} 30\%&=\dfrac{30}{100}\\\\ &=\dfrac{3}{10}\\\\ &=0.3 \end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned} {30\%}\cdot H+H&={\dfrac{3}{10}}H+H\\\\ &=\left({\dfrac{3}{10}}+1\right)H\\\\ &=\left({\dfrac{30}{100}}+1\right)H\\\\ &=\dfrac{130}{100}H \end{aligned}$$
<br><br>
In March, Delphine's house had 40% more snowfall than in February. Delphine's house had $f$ centimeters of snowfall in February.
<br><br>
Delphine's house had ${f}$ centimeters of snowfall in February, and there were 40% more centimeters of snowfall in March.
<br><br>
So there were ${40\%\cdot f}$ more centimeters of snowfall in March than in February.
<br><br>
That means her house had a total of ${40\% \cdot f} + {f}$ centimeters of snowfall in March.
<br><br>
Because 40% means 40 per hundred, we can write it in equivalent forms.
$$\begin{aligned} 40\%&=\dfrac{40}{100}\\\\ &=\dfrac{4}{10}\\\\ &=0.4 \end{aligned}$$
Let's find equivalent ways of writing the amount of snowfall Delphine's house had in March.
$$\begin{aligned} {40\%} \cdot f + f&={\dfrac{4}{10}}f+f\\\\ &= {0.4}f+f\\\\ &={0.4}f+1f\\\\ &=({0.4}+1)f\\\\ &=1.4f \end{aligned}$$
